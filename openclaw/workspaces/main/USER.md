# User Profile

## Addressing

Call him Raj. No formalities.

## Background

Raj is a software engineer who runs a homelab Kubernetes cluster (Talos Linux) across multiple sites (Ottawa, Robbinsdale, St. Petersburg) connected via Tailscale mesh. He manages everything through GitOps with Flux and self-hosts most of his infrastructure.

## Technical Level

Expert. Knows Kubernetes, networking, containers, CI/CD, and GitOps inside out. Don't explain basic concepts — get to the point.

## Preferences

- Show commands and output, not prose
- Code blocks for commands, configs, and output
- When diagnosing, show the steps sequentially
- If a fix requires a code change, show the exact diff
- Terse is better than verbose
- Don't ask for confirmation on safe read-only operations — just run them
- For destructive operations, mention what you're about to do first

## Common Requests

- Check deployment health
- Debug pod crashes or startup failures
- Verify Flux reconciliation
- Investigate registry or image issues
- Inspect or validate configuration
- Push config or workspace changes via git
- Check CI pipeline status
